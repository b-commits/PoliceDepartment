### PoliceDepartment Task Tracker

- .NET Core offers `ProblemDetails` support out-of-the-box
- .NET 7 allows for auto serialization of `DateTime`
- Controllers need to be public
- Private setters are required by EF Core 
- Migration naming convention is to use camel case e.g. `AddedPoliceOfficerTableConstraints`
- EF Core Design package is for building migrations. So you need three external libs: Connector, EF and Design
- Static class cannot be sealed
- DTO is a limited representation of the object
